# CipherSchools C++ and DSA Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to **C++** and **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** assignments from **CipherSchools**. Throughout this project, I've worked on various problems and assignments that have helped me deepen my understanding of C++ programming and fundamental DSA concepts.

## Overview

- **Course**: CipherSchools C++ and DSA Program
- **Focus**: Strengthening problem-solving skills in C++ and understanding essential data structures and algorithms.
- **Assignments**: The repository includes solutions to various exercises, including basic syntax, OOP concepts, and advanced DSA topics like sorting, searching, recursion, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Language**: All assignments are written in **C++**.

## Topics Covered

The assignments span across multiple core topics:

1. **C++ Basics and Syntax**  
   - Variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
   - Object-oriented programming (OOP) basics: classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Data Structures**  
   - Arrays, strings, and vectors.
   - Stacks, queues, and linked lists.
   - Trees (binary trees, binary search trees).
   - Graphs (DFS, BFS).
   - Hash maps and sets.

3. **Algorithms**  
   - Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, Merge sort).
   - Searching algorithms (Linear search, Binary search).
   - Recursion and backtracking (e.g., N-Queens, permutations).
   - Dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack problem).
   - Greedy algorithms (e.g., Activity selection problem).

4. **Complexity Analysis**  
   - Analyzing time and space complexity for different algorithms.
   - Big-O notation, and understanding the trade-offs between different approaches.
